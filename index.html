                        Drawing from her experiences as a dancer and choreographer, she incorporates artistic expressions into her technological projects. This creative approach enables her

                    <h3>REPENSTISMO - STRUKTUR IM CHAOS</h3>
                    <p> This choreography introduces the audience to the improvisation of the “Repentismo“ of Brazilian popular culture, 
                        which communicates with the concept of spontaneous „Poetry Slam“ in German. The transition between dialogue 
                        (slam poetry) and rhythm (Repentismo) provides a structure, although it exists in an atmosphere of chaos. 
                        In a second moment of the piece, the artist introduces slam poetry generated by artificial intelligence. 
                        She concludes that chaos, despite its imperfections, provides natural and essential aspects in the search for 
                        the structure of one ‘s identity.
                        How do technology and feelings communicate with each other and can be unified? 
                        All that with expressions of poetry, improvisation and structure, rhythm art and dance. 
                        With poems from artists such as Gerald Fiebig, Julia Engelman and also great poets from Brazil, 
                        are present by Gabriela Velasco with “Repentismo - Struktur im Chaos”.</p> <br>

                        <p> - A Solidão à Flor da Pele</p>
                         <h4>An essay on loneliness - In Memory of Ahyrton Ferreira Campos</h4>
                            <p>
                                In 2012, I was fortunate to receive support from the Ministry of Culture (MINC) 
                                for the presentation of my essay "Solitude on the Surface" 
                                at the Havana Vieja Ciudad en Movimiento Festival in Cuba. At the festival, 
                                I conducted workshops on contemporary dance infused with elements of 
                                Brazilian folk dance for audiences of all ages, including children. Additionally, 
                                I showcased my choreography, "Solitude on the Surface," a piece crafted by myself, 
                                Gabriela Velasco. This choreography was not only a creative expression but also a 
                                research of movements and essence inspired by butoh dance. It provided a unique opportunity 
                                to explore the depths of emotion, allowing us to dance with the memories of loved ones who 
                                are no longer with us, 
                                including my grandfather, Ahyrton.</p>
